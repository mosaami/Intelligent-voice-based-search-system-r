The main purpose of the software is to perform the tasks of the user at certain commands of speech. It will ease most of the work of the user as a complete task can be done on a single command. Our project draws its inspiration from Virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows and Siri for iOS. Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands. Currently, the project aims to provide a Virtual Assistant that would not only aid in their daily routine tasks like searching the web, extracting weather data, news headlines and many others but also help in automation of various activities.
